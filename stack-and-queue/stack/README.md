# Challenge Summary

### Feature Tasks

* Create a new class called pseudo queue.
1. Do not use an existing Queue.
2. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
3. Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
    
* Methods:

**enqueue**
            
1. Arguments: value
2. Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
        
**dequeue**

1. Arguments: none
2. Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h


## Approach & Efficiency

> What approach did you take ? 
* Algorithm 

> Why ?  
* Because it is stack-queue-pseudo

> What is the Big O space/time for this approach ? 
**Time : O(1)**

**Space : O(n)**
