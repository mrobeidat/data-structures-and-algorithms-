# Stack_and_Queue

Implementation: Stack_and_Queue
## Challenge
- [x]    Can successfully push onto a stack
- [x]   Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
- [x]    Can successfully pop off the stack
- [x]    Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- [x]    Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- [x]    Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- [x]    Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- [x]    Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- [x]    Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- [x]    Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- [x]    Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- [x]    Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- [x]    Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- [x]   Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception

## Approach & Efficiency
time=o(n)
space=o(1)
## API
+ push method :adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
+ pop method:Removes the node from the top of the stack.
+ peek :Returns Value of the node located at the top of the stack.
+ is empty:Returns Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
+ enqueue:adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
+ dequeue :Removes the node from the front of the queue.
