# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementation:  Extending an Implementation
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [x] Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list

- [x] Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time=o(n)
space=o(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
+ insert method :Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
+ Includes method:Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
+ string : a string representing all the values in the Linked List
+ insert before
this method takes two arguments the first one is the node wher i want to add before and the second one the new value that i want to add

+ insert after
it works the same as insert before but here we will add after specific node and its also contains two arguments the node i want to add after and the new value

+ Kth-method
Takes the index number as a parameter and its Return node value from the end of the linked_list.
